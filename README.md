# KALA Honeypot - Duke University Code+ Program 2024
This honeypot was created as a part of the 2024 Duke University Code+ Program.
## VPN Honeypot Overview
Our VPN honeypot is a specialized piece of software designed to mimic the behavior of a real virtual private network (VPN) service. Its primary purpose is to attract and deceive potential attackers, allowing the IT Security Office (ITSO) at Duke University, Cisco, and over 80 other universities across the country to gather threat intelligence by monitoring and analyzing the activities of these attackers.
